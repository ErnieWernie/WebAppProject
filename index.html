        <p>
            This is a little blog that I've set up. This will be a small section of the internet where I will talk about
            my experiences and thoughts about Cybersecurity and related topics!
            <br><br>
            I hope that whoever this finds will enjoy reading what I have to say as much as I enjoy writing about it!

                <h3>5 Essential Cybersecurity Practices Every Small Business Should Implement</h3>
                <p>It is expected that cybercrime will cost the world around $10.5 trillion(!!!!) USD annually by 2025! This cybercrime
                    is not limited to large scale companies, anyone could be targeted by these criminals! That's why I believe that it is essential for
                    small businesses to create backups for all data, implement strong and unique passwords, keep all their software updated, have
                    multi factor authentication and should educate all employees on the severity of being cyber safe. This way even the smallest of mom
                    and pop shops will be able to thrive without a major setback.

                <h3>Understanding the Dark Web: The Good and The Bad</h3>
                <p>
                    When I speak on the Dark Web, the people around me usually get frightened or are appalled at the thought of it. Why?
                    Is it really that horrible? Are there horrors lying beyond each click of our mouse? The Dark Web carries the connotation of guns,
                    drugs, violence and/or other depraved events. For those who are not aware, the Dark Web is encrypted online content that will not
                    and can not be reached by our traditional search engines. It requires a browser such as TOR  that provides the user with anonymity.
                    This would give the chance for people in heavily monitored areas of the world to be in contact with the outside!
                   <br><br>
                    TLDR: The Dark Web is just like the regular internet, just anonymous. It doesn ^`^yt inherently make it bad, it all depends on$
